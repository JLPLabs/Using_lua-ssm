=============

See the original work by Hui & Edwards:

Intent
------

Two goals for this repo, and both relate to documentation:

1. Using the annotations in the code, document the library's API.
2. Document use-cases for the library by expandin upon the examples provided in the repo and the narrative in the paper.
