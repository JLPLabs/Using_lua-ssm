SSM Lua Library â€“ API Reference
===============================

This document describes the public API of the Synchronous Sequential Model (SSM) Lua runtime,
including modules for scheduling, simulation, priority management, and reactive channels.

Time Definitions
----------------

These definitions can be found in ``lua-ssm/lua/ssm/core.lua``, with a few details extrapolated by the author.

  Comments/questions:
  [?] why is Duration an ``integer`` and Timestamp a ``number`` ?

=============================  ====================================================
Type                           Description
=============================  ====================================================
Duration                       An ``integer``, represents a span of time (logical or physical), measured in ticks.
LogicalTime                    Represents a point in logical time, comparable and arithmetic.
PhysicalTime                   Represents a point in "wall-clock" time
Timestamp                      A ``number``, represents a point in time (either logical or physical)

A comment on time...

  "The core library is resolution-agnostic, but for cross-platform accuracy we
  will standardize to nanoseconds as our base resolution. Each backend will
  need to adjust from nanoseconds accordingly." - from ``ssm.lua``


API
---

``as_msec(d: Duration|Timestamp) -> number``
  Converts Duration to number of msec

``as_nsec(d: Duration|Timestamp) -> number``
  Converts Duration to number of nsec

``as_sec(d: Duration|Timestamp)  -> number``
  Converts Duration to number of sec

``as_usec(d: Duration|Timestamp) -> number``
  Converts Duration to number of usec

``defer(func, ...)``
  Create a process from a function and passes it the remaining arguments (...), at a lower priority than the caller.
  The newly spawned process will executes its inaugural instant after the caller waits or terminates.

  If ``func`` has been added to ``ssm`` then can use method format: ``func:defer(...)``

``ipairs(t: table) -> ipairs iterator``
  An ipairs iterator that works for table with overloaded __ipairs

``msec(t: number) -> Duration``
  Converts numer of milliseconds to Duration.

``nsec(t: number) -> Duration``
  Converts numer of nanoseconds to Duration.

``pairs(t: table) -> pairs iterator``
  A pairs iterator that works for table with overloaded __pairs

``sec(t: number)  -> Duration``
  Converts numer of seconds to Duration.

``spawn(func, ...)``
  Create a process from a function and passes it the remaining arguments (...), at a higher priority than the caller.
  The caller will suspend as the newly spawned process executes its inaugural
  instant; the caller will resume execution in the same instant after the new
  process waits or terminates.

  If ``func`` has been added to ``ssm`` then can use method format: ``func:spawn(...)``

``unpack(t: table, i: number|nil)  -> ...``
  A table unpack that works for table with overloaded __index

``usec(t: number) -> Duration``
  Converts numer of microseconds to Duration.
