   * - Type
     - Description
   * - ``BasePriority``
     - A root priority object from which all other priorities are derived.
   * - ``Channel``
     - A reactive table abstraction with delayed updates.
   * - ``CTable``
     - A table with an attached ``Channel`` metatable.
   * - ``Duration``
     - An integer representing a time interval.
   * - ``Event``
     - A tuple ``{Time, value}`` representing a scheduled update.
   * - ``Key``
     - Any valid Lua table key.
   * - ``IsSched``
     - Either ``true`` or a table mapping ``Key`` to ``true``.
   * - ``LogicalTime``
     - A subclass of ``Timestamp`` used for logical scheduling.
   * - ``PhysicalTime``
     - A subclass of ``Timestamp`` used for real-world time tracking.
   * - ``Priority``
     - An object representing a position in a total order.
   * - ``Process``
     - A coroutine-based unit of execution.
   * - ``Timestamp``
     - A number representing a point in logical or physical time.

Method / Property              Description
=============================  ====================================================
Duration                       Represents a span of logical time.
Duration.ticks                 Number of ticks in the duration.
Duration.__add__(other)        Adds two durations.
Duration.__sub__(other)        Subtracts one duration from another.
Duration.__mul__(factor)       Multiplies the duration by a scalar.
Duration.__truediv__(factor)   Divides the duration by a scalar.
Duration.__eq__(other)         Checks equality between durations.
Duration.__lt__(other)         Checks if one duration is less than another.
Duration.__le__(other)         Checks if one duration is less than or equal to another.
=============================  ====================================================

Method / Property              Description
=============================  ====================================================
LogicalTime                    Represents a point in logical time.
LogicalTime.ticks              Number of ticks since time zero.
LogicalTime + Duration         Adds a duration to a logical time.
LogicalTime - Duration         Subtracts a duration from a logical time.
LogicalTime - LogicalTime      Returns the duration between two logical times.
LogicalTime.__eq__(other)      Checks equality between logical times.

=============================  ====================================================
Method                         Description
=============================  ====================================================
Routine(*args, **kwargs)       Represents an SSM routine that can be called, spawned, or deferred.
Routine.__call__(*args)        Calls the routine directly from the current process.
Routine.spawn(*args)           Spawns the routine in a new process with higher priority.
