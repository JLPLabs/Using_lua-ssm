Type Definitions
----------------

=============================  ====================================================
Type                           Description
=============================  ====================================================
Duration                       Represents a span of logical time, measured in ticks.
LogicalTime                    Represents a point in logical time, comparable and arithmetic.
Routine                        A callable object representing a schedulable SSM routine.
Event                          A synchronization primitive used for signaling between processes.
Process                        Represents a running SSM process with access to time and control flow.

LogicalTime Type
----------------

===============================  ====================================================
Properties and Methods           Description
===============================  ====================================================
LogicalTime.ticks: integer       Number of ticks since time zero.
