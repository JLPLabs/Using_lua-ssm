SSM Lua Library â€“ API Reference
===============================

This document describes the public API of the Synchronous Sequential Model (SSM) Lua runtime,
including modules for scheduling, simulation, priority management, and reactive channels.

  NOTE   This API reference was converted from Lua source annotated with
         LDoc and EmmyLua comments, with assistance from Microsoft Copilot.



Time Definitions
----------------

These definitions can be found in ``lua-ssm/lua/ssm/core.lua``, with a few details extrapolated by the author.

  Comments/questions:
  [?] why is Duration an ``integer`` and Timestamp a ``number`` ?

=============================  ====================================================
Type                           Description
=============================  ====================================================
Duration                       An ``integer``, represents a span of time (logical or physical), measured in ticks.
LogicalTime                    Represents a point in logical time, comparable and arithmetic.
PhysicalTime                   Represents a point in "wall-clock" time
Timestamp                      A ``number``, represents a point in time (either logical or physical) 
=============================  ====================================================

``ipairs(t: table) -> ipairs iterator``
  An ipairs iterator that works for table with overloaded __ipairs

Utlity Functions
----------------

The "lua" library in ``lua-ssm/lua/ssm/lib/lua.lua`` exists solely to provide these helpers.

========================================  ================================================
Function Signature                        Description
========================================  ================================================
ipairs(t: table) -> ipairs iterator       an ipairs iterator that works for table with overloaded __ipairs
pairs(t: table) -> pairs iterator         a pairs iterator that works for table with overloaded __pairs
unpack(t: table, i: number|nil)  -> ...   a table unpack that works for table with overloaded __index
========================================  ================================================


Time Resolution
---------------

  "The core library is resolution-agnostic, but for cross-platform accuracy we
  will standardize to nanoseconds as our base resolution. Each backend will
  need to adjust from nanoseconds accordingly." - from ``ssm.lua``

========================================  ================================================
Function Signature                        Description
========================================  ================================================
nsec(t: number) -> Duration               Converts numer of nanoseconds to Duration.
usec(t: number) -> Duration               Converts numer of microseconds to Duration.
msec(t: number) -> Duration               Converts numer of milliseconds to Duration.
sec(t: number)  -> Duration               Converts numer of seconds to Duration.
as_nsec(d: Duration|Timestamp) -> number  Converts Duration to number of nsec
as_usec(d: Duration|Timestamp) -> number  Converts Duration to number of usec
as_msec(d: Duration|Timestamp) -> number  Converts Duration to number of msec
as_sec(d: Duration|Timestamp)  -> number  Converts Duration to number of sec
